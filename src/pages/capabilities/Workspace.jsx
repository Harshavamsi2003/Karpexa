    { q: 'Will we lose mail history when migrating?', a: 'No. Mail, calendar, contacts and drive content move with folder structure and permissions preserved, and we run a co-existence period so both platforms work during the transition.' },
    { q: 'Can staff use their own devices?', a: 'Yes, through a managed profile that separates work data from personal. Company data can be wiped independently without touching anything of theirs.' },
    { q: 'How long does a migration take?', a: 'For under two hundred users, typically three to five weeks including preparation and a co-existence window. Complex shared-mailbox and permission estates extend that.' },
