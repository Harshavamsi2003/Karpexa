      'Maintenance contracts get bought on price and judged on the worst day of the year. What decides that day is unglamorous: whether a spare part is on a shelf within reach, whether an engineer is genuinely rostered for your city, and whether anyone visited before the failure. We build cover around your downtime cost — critical assets get standby units and tight response clocks, everything else gets sensible economics.',

    { q: 'What is not covered?', a: 'Consumables, physical or liquid damage, and anything the manufacturer has declared end-of-support with no parts channel. We list exclusions plainly in the contract rather than in a footnote.' },
    { q: 'How is the annual price set?', a: 'By asset count, age, criticality tier and site locations. You see the per-asset build-up, so trimming cover on low-impact equipment is a decision you can make with numbers.' },
    { q: 'Do preventive visits interrupt operations?', a: 'They are scheduled with you, usually outside production hours or during planned windows, and each visit ends with a written condition report.' },
