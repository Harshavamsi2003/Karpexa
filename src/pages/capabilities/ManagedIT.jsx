We take the running of it — the queue, the monitoring, the patch calendar, the 3am page — and give it structure: named owners, published response times, and a monthly report that shows what actually happened rather than what was promised.',

    { q: 'Does this replace our internal IT team?', a: 'Rarely, and we do not pitch it that way. The usual shape is that we take the repetitive and out-of-hours load while your internal people move on to work that needs business context.' },
    { q: 'What does an SLA actually commit you to?', a: 'Acknowledgement and restoration targets by severity, with monthly reporting against them and agreed service credits if we miss. The targets are set with you during transition, not handed down.' },
    { q: 'How long does onboarding take?', a: 'Four to eight weeks for a typical mid-size estate. Longer if documentation is thin, because we would rather spend that time discovering than assuming.' },
    { q: 'Can we start with a subset?', a: 'Yes. Many clients start with out-of-hours cover or monitoring only, then extend once the working relationship is proven.' },
