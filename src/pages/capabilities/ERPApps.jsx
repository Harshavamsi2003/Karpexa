The measure of success is how much manual re-entry disappears.',

    { q: 'Can you rescue an implementation that has stalled?', a: 'Frequently. We assess configuration quality, data integrity and where trust broke down, then propose either a reset of scope or a completion plan. Sometimes the honest advice is to stop.' },
    { q: 'Will our processes have to change?', a: 'Some will, and that is usually healthy. We distinguish between genuinely differentiating practices worth preserving and habits that exist because an old system demanded them.' },
