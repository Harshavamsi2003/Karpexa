The result is an environment where cost, access and blast radius are all deliberate choices.',

    { q: 'Will migrating take the business offline?', a: 'Most workloads move with a short, scheduled cutover and several rehearsals beforehand. Anything that genuinely cannot pause gets a replication-and-switch approach so downtime is measured in minutes.' },
    { q: 'Can you reduce our current bill without re-architecting?', a: 'Usually a meaningful amount, yes. Scheduling non-production, right-sizing over-provisioned instances and buying appropriate commitments are the fastest wins and require no application changes.' },
    { q: 'Do we need to move everything?', a: 'No, and you often should not. Latency-sensitive, licence-locked or heavily regulated workloads frequently belong on your own infrastructure. We design for the split rather than pretending it does not exist.' },
