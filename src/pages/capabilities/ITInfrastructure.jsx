      'Most infrastructure grows by accident — a switch added here, storage bolted on there, laptops bought in three different years from four different vendors. It works, until throughput, warranty or floor space runs out at exactly the wrong moment. We design your compute, storage, network and end-user estate as a single topology with a known capacity ceiling and a known refresh cycle, so growth is a planned decision rather than an emergency purchase order.',

  faqs: [
    { q: 'Can you work with hardware we have already bought?', a: 'Yes. We audit what you own, keep whatever still has useful life and warranty cover, and design the new topology around it. Replacing working kit for the sake of a neater invoice is not something we do.' },
    { q: 'Do we have to buy hardware through you?', a: 'No. We are happy to design and implement while you procure directly. Where we do supply, we show you the line-item pricing rather than a bundled figure.' },
    { q: 'How disruptive is a network cutover?', a: 'Typically a scheduled window outside business hours, with the previous configuration retained and reversible. For multi-site estates we cut over one site at a time so any surprise is contained.' },
    { q: 'What happens to the equipment we retire?', a: 'We handle secure data wiping, certified e-waste disposal and, where there is residual value, buy-back — and you get the certificates for your compliance file.' },
