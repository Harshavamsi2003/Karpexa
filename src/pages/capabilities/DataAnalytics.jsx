That is why the dashboards survive past the launch demo.',

    { q: 'How quickly do we see something real?', a: 'The first working dashboard on real data typically lands in four to six weeks. We deliberately scope a narrow first slice so value arrives before enthusiasm fades.' },
    { q: 'Can you work with our messy spreadsheets?', a: 'Yes, and most engagements start there. Spreadsheets are usually where the real business logic is hiding — we extract it, formalise it and retire the file.' },
